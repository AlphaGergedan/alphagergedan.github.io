# About me

I'm a software engineer and a researcher. I am currently working with
<a class="link" href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/sccs/personen/felix-dietrich/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Felix Dietrich</a>
in his group: **Physics-Enhanced Machine Learning** at the
<a class="link" href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sccs/people/chair/" target="_blank">Chair of Scientific Computing at TUM</a>
. This is my research/hobby blog where I plan to
share about topics that interest me and highlight exciting research papers. This is also a space to
dive into projects that I am working on and explore ideas for the future. Whether you're a fellow
researcher, a developer, or just curious about the *magic* of math and computer science, I hope you
find something here to spark your interest.

My interests include (but definitely not limited to)
- incorporating physical knowledge into mathematical models (e.g. neural networks),
- approximating dynamical systems using mathematical models,
- sampling neural networks (instead of training them *slowly* using gradient-descent),
- randomized algorithms and their analysis,
- custom (ergonomic) keyboards -- *paindrivendev* has introduced me this awesome stuff. Thank you, Yusuf!
- creating something that has excited me from scratch -- *yes, I like re-inventing the wheel sometimes...*,
- software solutions for failure resilience in HPC environments,
- web development, i.e. creating awesome apps that I personally find useful or fun to have,
- ...
